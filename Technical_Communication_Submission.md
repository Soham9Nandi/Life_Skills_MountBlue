# Apache Kafka

## What is Apache Kafka?
- It's an open-source distributed streaming system.
- It is used for various tasks, such as stream processing, real-time data pipelines, and data integration at scale.

## What's so special about it?
- *High Throughput*: It's able to handle high-velocity and high-volume data.
- *High Scalability*: It can be scaled up to a thousand brokers, and its partition log model allows elastic expansion and contraction of storage and processing capabilities.
- *Low Latency*: It can provide latency as low as 2ms.
- *Permanent Storage*: It safely and securely stores streams of data in a distributed, durable, and fault-tolerant cluster. This ensures that data records are reliably stored and can be accessed even when the server fails.
- *High Availability*: It can extend clusters efficiently over the availability zone or connect clusters across geographic regions.

## How does it work?
- It consists of two layers, the *Storage Layer* and the *Compute Layer*.
- This enables efficient, real-time data ingestion, streaming data pipelines, and storage access.
- It's designed to facilitate simplified data streaming between itself and external systems.
