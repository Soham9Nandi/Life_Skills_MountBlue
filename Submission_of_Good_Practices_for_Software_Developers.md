# Good Practices for Software Developers

### Question 1
Which point(s) were new to you?
### Answer 1
The things that were new to me are as follows:
1. Asking better questions by mentioning what solution we tried attempting and failed.
2. Picking up calls and mentioning that we won't be able to talk instead of just missing a call.
3. Over-communicating in the implementatin phase when the instructions are unclear to keep everyone on the same page

### Question 2
Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?
### Answer 2
I need to improve my questioning skills.
I plan to do so by documenting every solution I attempt, timing myself and letting myself fully focus on the problem for a specific time before asking someone else.
